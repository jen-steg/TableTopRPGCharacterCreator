    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>Preparing and Casting Spells
The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher.
To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of	 the spell’s level or higher. You regain all
expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. 
You prepare the list of cleric spells that are	available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric	
spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier +
your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell
slots.
For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four	1st-level	and	two	2nd-level	spell	slots.	With	a	
Wisdom	of	16,	your	list	of	prepared	spells	can	
include	six	spells	of	1st	or	2nd	level,	in	any	
combination.	If	you	prepare	the	1st-level	spell	cure	
wounds,	you	can	cast	it	using	a	1st-level	or	2nd-level	
slot.	Casting	the	spell	doesn’t	remove	it	from	your	
list	of	prepared	spells.
You	can	change	your	list	of	prepared	spells	when	
you	finish	a	long	rest.	Preparing	a	new	list	of	cleric	
spells	requires	time	spent	in	prayer	and	meditation:	
at	least	1	minute	per	spell	level	for	each	spell	on	
your	list.

Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom	is	your	spellcasting	ability	for	your	cleric	
spells.	The	power	of	your	spells	comes	from	your	
devotion	to	your	deity.	You	use	your	Wisdom	
whenever	a	cleric	spell	refers	to	your	spellcasting	
ability.	In	addition,	you	use	your	Wisdom	modifier	
when	setting	the	saving	throw	DC	for	a	cleric	spell	
you	cast	and	when	making	an	attack	roll	with	one.

Spell save DC =	8	+	your	proficiency	bonus	+
your	Wisdom	modifier

Spell attack modifier =	your	proficiency	bonus	+
your	Wisdom	modifier

Ritual Casting
You	can	cast	a	cleric	spell	as	a	ritual	if	that	spell	has	
the	ritual	tag	and	you	have	the	spell	prepared.

Spellcasting Focus
You	can	use	a	holy	symbol	(see	“Equipment”)	as	a	
spellcasting	focus	for	your	cleric	spells.

Divine Domain
Choose	one	domain	related	to	your	deity,	such	as	
Life.	Each	domain	is	detailed	at	the	end	of	the	class	
description,	and	each	one	provides	examples	of	gods	
associated	with	it.	Your	choice	grants	you	domain	
spells	and	other	features	when	you	choose	it	at	1st	
level.	It	also	grants	you	additional	ways	to	use	

Channel	Divinity	when	you	gain	that	feature	at	2nd	
level,	and	additional	benefits	at	6th,	8th,	and	17th	
levels.

Domain Spells
Each	domain	has	a	list	of	spells—its	domain	spells—
that	you	gain	at	the	cleric	levels	noted	in	the	domain	
description.	Once	you	gain	a	domain	spell,	you	
always	have	it	prepared,	and	it	doesn’t	count	against	
the	number	of	spells	you	can	prepare	each	day.
If	you	have	a	domain	spell	that	doesn’t	appear	on	
the	cleric	spell	list,	the	spell	is	nonetheless	a	cleric	
spell	for	you.

Channel Divinity
At	2nd	level,	you	gain	the	ability	to	channel	divine	
energy	directly	from	your	deity,	using	that	energy	to	
fuel	magical	effects.	You	start	with	two	such	effects:	
Turn	Undead	and	an	effect	determined	by	your	
domain.	Some	domains	grant	you	additional	effects	
as	you	advance	in	levels,	as	noted	in	the	domain	
description.
When	you	use	your	Channel	Divinity,	you	choose	
which	effect	to	create.	You	must	then	finish	a	short	
or	long	rest	to	use	your	Channel	Divinity	again.
Some	Channel	Divinity	effects	require	saving	
throws.	When	you	use	such	an	effect	from	this	class,	
the	DC	equals	your	cleric	spell	save	DC.
Beginning	at	6th	level,	you	can	use	your	Channel	
Divinity	twice	between	rests,	and	beginning	at	18th	
level,	you	can	use	it	three	times	between	rests.	When	
you	finish	a	short	or	long	rest,	you	regain	your	
expended	uses.

Channel Divinity: Turn Undead
As	an	action,	you	present	your	holy	symbol	and	
speak	a	prayer	censuring	the	undead.	Each	undead	
that	can	see	or	hear	you	within	30	feet	of	you	must	
make	a	Wisdom	saving	throw.	If	the	creature	fails	its	
saving	throw,	it	is	turned	for	1	minute	or	until	it	
takes	any	damage.
A	turned	creature	must	spend	its	turns	trying	to	
move	as	far	away	from	you	as	it	can,	and	it	can’t	
willingly	move	to	a	space	within	30	feet	of	you.	It	
also	can’t	take	reactions.	For	its	action,	it	can	use	
only	the	Dash	action	or	try	to	escape	from	an	effect	
that	prevents	it	from	moving.	If	there’s	nowhere	to	
move,	the	creature	can	use	the	Dodge	action.
Not	for	resale.	Permission	granted	to	print	or	photocopy	this	document	for	personal	use	only. System	Reference	Document	5.1 17
Ability Score Improvement
When	you	reach	4th	level,	and	again	at	8th,	12th,	
16th,	and	19th	level,	you	can	increase	one	ability	
score	of	your	choice	by	2,	or	you	can	increase	two	
ability	scores	of	your	choice	by	1.	As	normal,	you	
can’t	increase	an	ability	score	above	20	using	this	
feature.

Destroy Undead
Starting	at	5th	level,	when	an	undead	fails	its	saving	
throw	against	your	Turn	Undead	feature,	the	
creature	is	instantly	destroyed	if	its	challenge	rating	
is	at	or	below	a	certain	threshold,	as	shown	in	the	
Destroy	Undead	table.

Destroy	Undead
Cleric Level      Destroys Undead of CR...
5th                             1/2 or lower
8th                              1 or lower
11th                            2 or lower
14th                            3 or lower
17th                            4 or lower

Divine Intervention
Beginning	at	10th	level,	you	can	call	on	your	deity	to	
intervene	on	your	behalf	when	your	need	is	great.
Imploring	your	deity’s	aid	requires	you	to	use	
your	action.	Describe	the	assistance	you	seek,	and	
roll	percentile	dice.	If	you	roll	a	number	equal	to	or	
lower	than	your	cleric	level,	your	deity	intervenes.	
The	GM	chooses	the	nature	of	the	intervention;	the	
effect	of	any	cleric	spell	or	cleric	domain	spell	would	
be	appropriate.
If	your	deity	intervenes,	you	can’t	use	this	feature	
again	for	7	days.	Otherwise,	you	can	use	it	again	
after	you	finish	a	long	rest.
At	20th	level,	your	call	for	intervention	succeeds	
automatically,	no	roll	required.

Life Domain
The	Life	domain	focuses	on	the	vibrant	positive	
energy—one	of	the	fundamental	forces	of	the	
universe—that	sustains	all	life.	The	gods	of	life	
promote	vitality	and	health	through	healing	the	sick	
and	wounded,	caring	for	those	in	need,	and	driving	
away	the	forces	of	death	and	undeath.	Almost	any	
non-evil	deity	can	claim	influence	over	this	domain,	
particularly	agricultural	deities	(such	as	Chauntea,	
Arawai,	and	Demeter),	sun	gods	(such	as	Lathander,	
Pelor,	and	Re-Horakhty),	gods	of	healing	or	
endurance	(such	as	Ilmater,	Mishakal,	Apollo,	and	
Diancecht),	and	gods	of	home	and	community	(such	
as	Hestia,	Hathor,	and	Boldrei).
Life	Domain	Spells

Cleric	Level Spells
1st bless,	cure	wounds
3rd lesser	restoration,	spiritual	weapon
5th beacon	of	hope,	revivify
7th death	ward,	guardian	of	faith
9th mass	cure	wounds,	raise	dead

Bonus Proficiency
When	you	choose	this	domain	at	1st	level,	you	gain	
proficiency	with	heavy	armor.

Disciple of Life
Also	starting	at	1st	level,	your	healing	spells	are	
more	effective.	Whenever	you	use	a	spell	of	1st	level	
or	higher	to	restore	hit	points	to	a	creature,	the	
creature	regains	additional	hit	points	equal	to	2	+	
the	spell’s	level.

Channel Divinity: Preserve Life
Starting	at	2nd	level,	you	can	use	your	Channel	
Divinity	to	heal	the	badly	injured.
As	an	action,	you	present	your	holy	symbol	and	
evoke	healing	energy	that	can	restore	a	number	of	
hit	points	equal	to	five	times	your	cleric	level.	
Choose	any	creatures	within	30	feet	of	you,	and	
divide	those	hit	points	among	them.	This	feature	can	
restore	a	creature	to	no	more	than	half	of	its	hit	
point	maximum.	You	can’t	use	this	feature	on	an	
undead	or	a	construct.

Blessed Healer
Beginning	at	6th	level,	the	healing	spells	you	cast	on	
others	heal	you	as	well.	When	you	cast	a	spell	of	1st	
level	or	higher	that	restores	hit	points	to	a	creature	
other	than	you,	you	regain	hit	points	equal	to	2	+	the	
spell’s	level.

Divine Strike
At	8th	level,	you	gain	the	ability	to	infuse	your	
weapon	strikes	with	divine	energy.	Once	on	each	of	
your	turns	when	you	hit	a	creature	with	a	weapon	
attack,	you	can	cause	the	attack	to	deal	an	extra	1d8	
radiant	damage	to	the	target.	When	you	reach	14th	
level,	the	extra	damage	increases	to	2d8.

Supreme Healing
Starting at	17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points	with	a	spell,	
you	instead	use	the	highest	number	possible	for	
Not	for	resale.	Permission	granted	to	print	or	photocopy	this	document	for	personal	use	only. System	Reference	Document	5.1 18

points	to	a	creature,	you	restore	12.</value>

  <data name="richTextBoxWizardSpells.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Spellcasting 
As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first 
glimmerings of your true power.

Cantrips 
At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn 
additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known 
column of the Wizard table. 

Spellbook 
At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your 
spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are 
fixed in your mind. 

Preparing and Casting Spells 
The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level 
and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. 
You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. 

You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a 
number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your 
wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have 
spell slots. For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and 
two 2nd-level spell slots.
 
With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level,
in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic 
missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2ndlevel slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove 
it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new 
list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the 
incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell 
level for each spell on your list.
 
Spellcasting Ability 
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells 
through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell 
refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when 
setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll 
with one. 

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
 
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
 
Ritual Casting 
You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in 
your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.
 
Spellcasting Focus 
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher 
Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your 
spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, 
as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you 
can add to your spellbook (see “Your Spellbook”). 

Arcane Recovery 
You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. 
Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to 
recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half 
your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. For 
example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell 
slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.

Your Spellbook 
The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you 
conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature 
of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover 
a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an 
ancient library. 

Copying a Spell into the Book. 
When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is 
of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.
 
Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then 
deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must 
practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it 
into your spellbook using your own notation. 

For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents 
material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as 
the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can 
prepare the spell just like your other spells. 

Replacing the Book
You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want 
to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your 
spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know 
how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied 
spell. If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells 
that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook 
requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep 
backup spellbooks in a safe place. 

The Book’s Appearance
Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and 
margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift 
from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even 
a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a 
mishap.

Arcane Tradition 
When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic 
through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, 
Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation. The school of Evocation is detailed at the end of 
the class description. 
Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.
 
Ability Score Improvement 
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one 
ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. 
As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
 
Spell Mastery 
At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them 
at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your 
spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot 
when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must 
expend a spell slot as normal. By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or 
both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels. 

Signature Spells 
When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them 
with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature 
spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of 
spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without 
expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or 
long rest. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as 
normal. 

Arcane Traditions 
The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. 
It is firmly established in the worlds of D&amp;D, with various traditions dedicated to its complex 
study. The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of 
magic. 
Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into 
eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. 
Elsewhere, they are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for 
students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own 
towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each 
school require mastery of different techniques.

School of Evocation 
You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, 
searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find 
employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others 
use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, 
adventurers, or aspiring tyrants. 

Evocation Savant 
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to 
copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.
 
Sculpt Spells 
Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your 
evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can 
see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures 
automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if 
they would normally take half damage on a successful save. 

Potent Cantrip 
Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the 
effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes 
half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.
 
Empowered Evocation 
Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any 
wizard evocation spell you cast.

Overchannel 
Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a 
wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage 
with that spell. The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature 
again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, 
immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long 
rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance 
and immunity.</value>

Fighting Style 
You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following 
options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to 
choose again. 

Archery 
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.
 
Defense 
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. 

Dueling 
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain 
a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. 

Great Weapon Fighting 
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon 
that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, 
even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile 
property for you to gain this benefit. 

Protection 
When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, 
you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be 
wielding a shield.

Two-Weapon Fighting 
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the 
damage of the second attack. 

Second Wind 
You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. 
On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter 
level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it 
again. 

Action Surge 
Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On 
your turn, you can take one additional action. Once you use this feature, you must finish 
a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice 
before a rest, but only once on the same turn. 

Martial Archetype 
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and 
techniques. The Champion archetype is detailed at the end of the class description. Your 
archetype grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. 

Ability Score Improvement 
When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can 
increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your 
choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. 

Extra Attack 
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack 
action on your turn. The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in 
this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class. Indomitable Beginning at 9th 
level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, 
and you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest. You can use this feature 
twice between long rests starting at 13th level and three times between long rests starting 
at 17th level.

Martial Archetypes 
Different fighters choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess. The 
martial archetype you choose to emulate reflects your approach. 

Champion 
The archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical power honed to 
deadly perfection. Those who model themselves on this archetype combine rigorous 
training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows. 

Improved Critical 
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your weapon attacks score a 
critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. 

Remarkable Athlete 
Starting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency bonus (round up) to any Strength, 
Dexterity, or Constitution check you make that doesn’t already use your proficiency 
bonus. In addition, when you make a running long jump, the distance you can cover 
increases by a number of feet equal to your Strength modifier. 

Additional Fighting Style 
At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style class feature. 

Superior Critical 
Starting at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18–20.
 
Survivor 
At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your 
turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you have no more

  <data name="richTextBoxRogueFeatures.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to 
gain this benefit. 

Sneak Attack 
Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. 
Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack
if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. 
You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of 
it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll. The 
amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak 
Attack column of the Rogue table. 

Thieves’ Cant 
During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and 
code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another 
creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer 
to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly. In addition, you 
understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such
as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, 
or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on 
the run. 

Cunning Action 
Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. 
You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only
to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action. 

Roguish Archetype 
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities.
The Thief archetype is detailed here; see the Player’s Handbook for other archetypes. Your 
choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. 

Ability Score Improvement 
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase
 one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice 
by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. 

Uncanny Dodge 
Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use 
your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.
 
Evasion 
Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as
 a red dragon’s fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that
 allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no
 damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
 
Reliable Talent 
By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever
 you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll
 of 9 or lower as a 10.
 
Blindsense 
Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or
 invisible creature within 10 feet of you.
 
Slippery Mind 
By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom 
saving throws.
 
Elusive 
Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against
 you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t incapacitated.

Stroke of Luck 
At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack 
misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an 
ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it 
again until you finish a short or long rest. 

Roguish Archetypes 
Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, 
their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But 
different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. 
Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus—not necessarily an indication of your 
chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques. 

Thief 
You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals 
typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as 
professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving
 your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading 
unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn’t employ. 

Fast Hands 
Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make 
a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves’ tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, 
or take the Use an Object action. 

Second-Story Work 
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; 
climbing no longer costs you extra movement. In addition, when you make a running jump,
 the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.
 
Supreme Sneak 
Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more 
than half your speed on the same turn. 

Use Magic Device 
By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise 
the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level 
requirements on the use of magic items. 

Thief’s Reflexes 
When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping
danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn 
at your normal.</value>
